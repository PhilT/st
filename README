st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Patches
-------
* Scrollback with Shift+PgUp/PgDn or mouse wheel
* Del key patch did not work. Instead `cat` followed by pressing delete,
  then entered the result into `/etc/inputrc` (substituting `^[` for `\e`)
  e.g. `sudo sed -i 's/.*: delete-char/"\\e[P": delete-char/' /etc/inputrc`


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
